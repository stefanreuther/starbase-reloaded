v0.43 (12/Sep/2020)
-------------------

Handle UnitsPerTorpRate (robot 4X bonus) and UnitsPerWebRate for
minefields. This option needs to be handled in the same way as for
ships. Otherwise, Robots could produce unlimited torpedoes by laying
mines with ships (using 4X bonus) and scooping them with bases (not
honoring the 4X bonus, therefore producing 4X the torpedoes used for
laying the field).
